# NBA Team Performance Analyzer

A modern SwiftUI application that leverages AI to provide intelligent analysis of NBA team performance comparisons. Built with cutting-edge iOS development technologies to demonstrate proficiency in mobile development.

## Current Features

- **Multi-Team Comparison**: Select 2-4 NBA teams for analysis
- **Customizable Time Range**: Analyze performance over 5, 10, 15, or 20 games
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Get intelligent analysis of team performance patterns
- **Modern SwiftUI Interface**: Clean, responsive design with smooth animations
- **Real-time Data**: Live NBA statistics integration

## Technical Stack

- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Swift Concurrency**: Async/await for efficient data handling
- **Composable Architecture (TCA)**: Predictable state management
- **Combine**: Reactive programming patterns
- **Core Data**: Local data persistence and caching

## User Experience

1. **Team Selection**: Browse and select 2-4 NBA teams
2. **Game Range**: Choose how many recent games to analyze
3. **Data Processing**: Real-time fetching of team statistics
4. **AI Analysis**: Receive intelligent insights about team performance
5. **Results Display**: Clean comparison of statistics and AI insights

## Example Analysis

When comparing Warriors vs Lakers over the past 10 games:
- "The Lakers performed better in high-scoring games with an average of 118.5 PPG"
- "Warriors show stronger defensive metrics, holding opponents to 42.3% shooting"
- "Lakers have better offensive efficiency in transition, scoring 1.2 points per possession"
